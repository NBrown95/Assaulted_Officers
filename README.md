# Assaulted_Officers

This project will help predict and identify factors that may contribute to the assault of police officers. 

The source of this data is from the website https://data.louisvilleky.gov/dataset/assaulted-officers. This dataset contains information regarding officers who were assaulted on the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department (LMPD) in Kentucky from 2010 to Present.

I chose this topic because officers are currently working in one of the most hostile and stressful environments in the history of law enforcement. Using data and information to determine scenarios where officers are more likely to be assaulted may help reduce these incidents in the future. This can also lead to better training and/or a change in tactics regarding certain factors that increase likelihood of an assault on officers. Changing these tactics can increase officer safety.
